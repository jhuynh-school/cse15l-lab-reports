Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code

* If you already have Visual Studio Code installed from CSE 8B you can skip this step entirely
* Go to this [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to download Visual Studio Code
* If you are using Windows you have to download [git](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [bash](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994)
* If you are using Unix or Linux you can continue to the next step

Step 2: Connecting to the Remote Server

* Use $ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu (zz should be your course specific account)
* Your command line should look similar to the one in the picture above
* If it states that it was closed by the remote user, wait about 15-25 mins and try again

Step 3: Running Commands in the Terminal
---

* Try some commands in the command line to get yourself familiar
* Test multiple cases that seem different from the standard to see how the command line reacts
* Some commands include cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and cp
* Some examples of what the commands do are cd and mkdir which can be seen in the examples above. 
* cd is short for change directory, it helps us move in and out of directories. cd can be used to go into a directory by typing the path after cd showing where the file is relative to the current directory. cd can also be used to move out a directory by using cd ..
* mkdir is short for make directory, which does exactly as its said, it creates a new directory within your working directory. In the example above mkdir is used to create the new directory hello.
* By using a combination of different command line commands it helps us navigate, make, delete, and list information by using the command line.
